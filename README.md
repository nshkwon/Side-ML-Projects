# Side-ML-Projects
## A collection of various Hands-on Machine Learning Projects using Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Python.

Welcome to my repository of ML projects! This collection is a showcase of my ML projects using Kaggle datasets for continuous learning and exploration purposes.


## Project details
Below is a list of projects contained within this repository:
- **Project 1**: [Loan Approval Prediction]
  - **Description**: Loan approval classification using various classification algorithms (such as SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc) and Ensemble learning. 

- **Project 2**: [House Price Prediction]
  - **Description**: House price prediction using Ensemble learning (with XGBoost, KNN, Neural Network, etc), coupled with hyper-parameter tuning to improve accuracy.

- **Project 3**: [Customer Clustering]
  - **Description**: Segmentation of customers using Kmeans clustering algorithm.
 
- **Project 4**: [Sentiment Analysis]
  - **Description**:
    - 4-1) Sentiment analysis (NLP) using Back of Words (Accuracy: Naive Bayes: 63.0%, XGBoost: 79.5%)
    - 4-2) Sentiment analysis (NLP) using Tokenizer, Embedding, and Bi-diretional LSTM with Tensorflow (Accuracy: 92.5%)

- **Project 5**: [Image Classification]
  - **Description**: Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Tensorflow (Accuracy: 97.5%)




These projects are designed to enhance my machine learning skills, as well as to explore different aspects of algorithms. 
I am committed to updating this repository with new projects as my exploration advances. Stay tuned for more updates!
